This is my notebook for House Prices Competition
I took 767/43299 place on old competition
and 944/4173 on new one, datasets are the same, so i leave only one notebook here
In this notebook i preprocessed the data with my own analysis of market, imputed all missing values by KNN algorithm 
and modeled prediction based ob GradientBoostingRegressor.
Evaluation is log squarred RMSE, - best score is 0.12790 which is about 14k dollars prediction error
